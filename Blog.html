				<h1><br>Technology</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Just take a moment, look around and see how advanced the world has became. Isn't it amazing that the human beings have stepped into the soil outside the Earth ? For, me it's an outstanding achievement for which all the credit goes to technology that the human beings have built over the last century. Just look at the background picture of this blog, the beautiful big buildings, bridge and all the cars with latest technologies running on that bridges, they are all built by the help of latest artificial technologies. Moreover, the camera that took this picture is also the part of the technology created by the human beings. We can see the influence of technology around us easily. Personally for me, the world has became a better place to live in.<br><br> We are living in an era of advanced technology, where every part of our daily lives is related to the science of craft in one way or another. The development of technology has led to so many mind-blowing discoveries like the capture of first ever picture of a black hole recently. To be honest, technology has dramatically changed our daily lives. We can see how easy it is to travel to different countries. It would take years to travel to different countries had we not have any technologes with us. Moreover, we wouldn't even know if there is peoples living in another country. Who would have imagined this a century ago that we will be able to video chat with a person, thousands of miles away just with a touch of finger on our smart phones. So, we are lucky to live in this era where the world is on our hands. But, we should not get satisfied with what we have today. We also should innovate and discover new technolgies that will bring positive changes to the lives of all upcoming generations. Below, I will give my opinions regarding the effects of technology on my daily life with the help of it's negative and postive effects. </p><br>

				<h1><br>Negative effects of Technology</h1>

				<p>Talking about the negative effects, the world today is crowded with technology. We can see peoples with mobile phone everytimeModern technology has absolute control over our lives. Nowadays we work, love, shop, play and communicate with each other and the world online. Day by day, it is making all of us lazy to do any kind of physical activities since everything can be done by just sitting at home. We spend more time with mobile phones and televisions than with our family. We become less friendly with our family. Sometimes, I feel sad for old peoples because people of this generation are all busy with mobile phones and computers and they don't have anyone to talk with at home. 10 years ago, I could see almost every grandparents sticking with their grand-childrens for most of the time. But now, even small kids are addicted to mobile phones. There’s no doubt that modern technology has improved the communication between peoples. However, there is a serious lack of contact with other people and social activities. Thus, making all of us anti-social. <br><br> Technology is taken for granted. We all know that technology is affecting our brains badly but we also cannot resist using technology for few hours because we are now used to it. Today, Human brain cannot cope with the challenges of modern devices, so the excessive use of modern technology reduces our concentration, productivity and affects our way of thinking. Therefore, we feel much lazy, and find it difficult to study books and try to understand new things. We permanently lose the ability to work on something serious. I also believe that technology causes procastination since I was also the victim of it. I think that technology is affecting our health. Constantly looking at devices causes head and neck pain, loss of eyesight and hearing and so on and is making people unhealthy as well. Similarly, lack of privacy, stress, poor sleep habits, addiction, mental health and disturbance in our education are all the negative effect that is brought by the technology. This is what I think about the negative effects of the technology.

 				<h1><br>Positive effects of Technology</h1>
 					
 				<p>Every thing in this world has two sides and so does technology. All the bad effects that I've mentioned above can easily 			   be dealt by using technology in a proper way for less time. It’s not difficult to recognize just how much of the technology 				  we use on a daily basis — from computers, cell phones, laptops, tablets and TVs to refrigerators and convection ovens that 			    cook food evenly. Technology has brought huge difference in our lives as compared to how the life was a century ago. 					   People today can talk with their friends far away from them whenever they want to. These advanced communication tech tools 				 have helped us to eliminate time and distance as obstacles. <br><br>Not that long ago, our entertainment experiences used 				   to live only in the moment they happened, exist in our memories and find their way in old-fashioned photographs on wall. 			   Now, it is all different. We can record every moment of our precious memories and look at it whenever we want to until 				   the last  breath of our lives which is amazing. Similarly, the majority of the items that we have in our house are all 				   automated. The  CC camera installed in our house plays an important role to prevent us from robbery and any kinds of 				   physical threats. Today, there is cure for almost every illness of the world, even illness like cancer and heart disease. 				Advanced research  and modern technology has made it a lot easier to diagnose and treat illnesses. From the very start, 				   technology made life easier for people. It has opened lots of doors to many opportunities that looked unlikely to be 				   achievable before. If we are far from our family, we don't have to write letters to our family like the old days 				       where it used to take serveral months to be delivered. We can video chat with them whenever we want to with the help of  			   mobile and compputers. Similarly, technology also helps in business and education in many ways. Technology has many 					   positive effects because of which I consider it as human being's greatest achievements.
